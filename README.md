# RProxy LAB by EvilWhales
RProxy LAB by EvilWhales  is a research project aimed at studying reverse proxy server configurations for authentication testing in controlled authorized environments. This repository provides custom configurations and modifications based on advanced reverse proxy platforms such as Modlishka, Evilginx, EvilPuppet and others. These tools are designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and red team employees to explore authentication vulnerabilities and develop secure systems.

#### Note: This project is intended solely for educational purposes and authorized testing. Any unauthorized or malicious use is strictly prohibited. The developer is not responsible for any misuse of the provided materials.

#### RProxy LAB aims to provide a collection of proxy configurations and modifications for studying authentication mechanisms. The repository includes:

- Custom configurations for reverse proxy frameworks, inspired by Modlishka, Evilginx, EvilPuppet and others.
- Modifications to enhance functionality for security testing in controlled environments.
- Examples of authentication templates for analyzing session management and token capture techniques.

#### This project is designed for:

- Security researchers studying reverse proxy technologies.
- Penetration testers conducting authorized assessments.
- Developers learning about authentication vulnerabilities in controlled lab settings.
